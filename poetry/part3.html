<h2>Part 3</h2></br>

<h3><a href="../index.html">Home</a></h3>

</br>
</br>
I used to live in abandoned refrigerators,</br>
there, seahorses shuddering down the pathway</br>
propelled by drumbeats.</br>
That was at first.</br>
</br>
I have seen a metal hat of candles</br>
held up and dancing in the jet of a fountain.</br>
(if I was a metal hat I'd be a man.</br>
I'd be a riddle that I would forget and then remember</br>
one hundred times.)</br>
</br><hr>


</br>
</br>
Here we are again, and again for the first time.</br>
Pretend you're nobody,</br>
or anybody.</br>
Pretend that it is the Garden of the Morning of the World.</br>
Imagine whatever clothes you might picture yourself in,</br>
how many faces have you been?</br>
The wind blowing fields of soft grasses and wildflowers before your steps,</br>
waiting to meet the one who waits for you.</br>
It is the measure of all of your possible Love</br>
laid open in the warm air.</br>
Do you remember this place?</br>
Have you forgotten so soon?</br>
Can you at least remember that you once thought</br>
that the world could be experienced in this way?</br>
How and why did you change?</br>
How were you misled?</br>
When did you give up this beautiful mystery </br>
for your hard hard house of regret.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
I have left wreckage in six cities.</br>
I am not proud of it.</br>
Better to live well in one place with your family about you</br>
and your climate as given,</br>
your possessions all in one place,</br>
your memories within travelling distance</br>
perhaps just a long walk away.</br>
Everything I have done has gone to air,</br>
set aside,</br>
wasted.</br>
</br>
And from this moment the world is no longer young.</br>
From this moment time has begun to flow from one boundless ocean</br>
to another.</br>
From this moment hearts will harden to dead gnarled root</br>
and singing will end.</br>
Pleasure will separate from joy and become more and more base</br>
until all that is left is the fragrance from an empty bottle,</br>
a kiss of brutal pride,</br>
pressed to lips wet with delicious humiliation.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
Whenever I'm having trouble with the world</br>
I take it out on myself.</br>
My most clever feature is a strong back.</br>
The cup is before each of us.</br>
Someone must drink the poison.</br>
Someone's throat must turn to Blue.</br>
And so it goes on and on and on,</br>
so tired of falling to the floor hungry for humiliation,</br>
I resign.</br>
I just want to wear a black military shirt</br>
and Italian trousers and take photographs of myself </br>
as the fierce passionate Idealistic Fascist.</br>
Then I want to kiss the Sultan's black-eyed daughter</br>
and see her smile sweetly in the moonlight</br>
in her fragrant blossoming orchard.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
In the distance is a flag drenched in rainwater</br>
faded, and barely able to move in the wind.</br>
This is my zeal.</br>
Last night I opened a letter </br>
and it said only "Remember".</br>
When my voice has become just a tearful swallowed taste</br>
in the throat, what is it saying?</br>
Someone says that the price of such lovely delirium</br>
is a smashed life,</br>
all to kiss the black-eyed girl forever in the Garden of Play.</br>
My voice is trying to say "done" (without hesitation...)</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
PS. One more letter. This one to you.</br>
It says "Take this one chance, whoever you think you are"</br>
</br>
</br>
Sincerely yours,</br>
</br>
No one able to do you any harm</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
You fill my brain</br>
with six and eight</br>
It sticks my hat</br>
It sticks my Jack</br>
You call this rude Face</br>
You call this Fact</br>
Too slow. Too Need LOve.</br>
(Sorry. Sorry Back)</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
I have learned the "ice skating" water principle from music.</br>
I have also learned the "dressing up in costume" principle.</br>
My whispering words go out to you announcing their messages</br>
behind veils and with gifts.</br>
Gardens and beehives and costume parties all the time.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
Every little accident takes time</br>
to get just right.</br>
Bleak muted trumpets.</br>
Nasil oboe.</br>
Soft voices.</br>
friendly (speaking of things known by both)</br>
enjoying each other's company</br>
laughing now and then</br>
no background.</br>
life.</br>
the vignettes,</br>
again and again.</br>
I would know you anywhere</br>
soft voices</br>
laughing now and then</br>
I would know you</br>
the pleasantries</br>
the clothes.</br>
the place</br>
I would know you everywhere.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
Smoking undersea doors</br>
the conveyer belt</br>
threadworn</br>
gulls laughing through their teeth</br>
fish once again in the seas,</br>
before any of this, when there were hills of flowers everywhere</br>
When we are dead we will float over watery moods oblivious to time.</br>
We tremble to think how much we have to live.</br>
Our condition made beautiful by this hard living</br>
and made good by recieving an irrational Grace.</br>
We leave our difficulties in another place,</br>
the air showering outward with quiet pastel</br>
and we are Gone to the Garden of Enjoyment, </br>
Deeper into the Afternoon than we ever could have been </br>
in all the groaning sincere rehearsals and simulations </br>
of the one Eternal Moment</br>
in all times and all places</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
Accidents come from nowhere and find us when we're lost.</br>
Whenever there is a downpour</br>
I remember one night running out of a bar we were at till 2</br>
drinking vodkas and lime,</br>
rain coming down so thick we could barely see</br>
running on the black gleaming street</br>
my shirt soaked and my vision rising ever upward via</br>
intoxicated thoroughness,</br>
your blouse transparent, </br>
your black heels and that silly old-fashioned scarf,</br>
laughing,</br>
yelling,</br>
and laughing.</br>
we were magic then.</br>
we were immortal.</br>
Anyone would have wanted to be us,</br>
and, in a way, we *were* everyone,</br>
laughing,</br>
yelling,</br>
and laughing.</br>
running on the black gleaming street.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
Love in the afterglide</br>
needles in the bed of pines</br>
a white white rose</br>
a ring of tin</br>
a bottle of wine</br>
visions that only rise up</br>
parties that only just Begin.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
Surprise</br>
what you expected is really true.</br>
You have been given a rare chance to go behind the scenes,</br>
to peak behind the curtain,</br>
the brown paper curtain painted in watercolors like </br>
in a kindergarten play.</br>
Do the things you *love* to do</br>
if you are lucky enough to have even a chance.</br>
</br>
There is a boat moving along a line</br>
there is a person in the boat</br>
there is a cloud in the sky</br>
water on a rock</br>
cold northern air</br>
on the stretched cloth.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
The cream rats sliding north</br>
and rising off the dome of night toward other planets.</br>
</br>
The little mermaid never existed did she?</br>
Or else you never found one another</br>
and she faded into the crowd.</br>
</br>
Grow old.</br>
Be as happy as you can.</br>
You will never be as happy as you once were.</br>
Your life accumulates in the dark,</br>
sliding out into the night,</br>
you say you need more *time*.</br>
</br>
Here in this house</br>
where the walls weep the years</br>
Here where I have ruined my life</br>
broken and carted away</br>
You would have found me here</br>
if you had bothered to come</br>
Here with wild and teary eyes gone to Circles,</br>
for he on botched imploded melon has fed,</br>
and drunk the gasoline of Paradise.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
I received his two last letters.</br>
Snow was falling in the Park and snowflakes fell on the page.</br>
It was a heavy snowfall, a quiet night </br>
the way large snowflakes still the car noise far away.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
Friend,</br>
</br>
Your hope is the basis for my continued belief</br>
that people are essentially good, </br>
especially when living in small numbers.</br>
An infinite number of souls would light the lamp</br>
and lead the the Caravan away.</br>
This was proved by a young mathematician who used to </br>
enjoy walking through piles of dead leaves in late October.</br>
There were vines of wine red leaves and the pungent marigolds</br>
were finally dry and pale.</br>
Many adventures were accompanied by the smell of marigolds</br>
and the taste of cheap wine.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
Dear _____,</br>
</br>
You may wish to come to the high Mountains next Spring.</br>
No one will be there and the mountains will deceive you </br>
with their beauty.</br>
If you come there I will give you a racetrack.</br>
At night you will never cease to be amazed by the graceful</br>
horizontal blur of the dogs.</br>
Learn affection and loyalty and steadfastness from them.</br>
Tonight low clouds roll over the moon.</br>
My spirit is out running and howling with the dogs -</br>
faster and faster across the flat track,</br>
faster than a true heart coming to a decision,</br>
I am Everywhere in the bowl of Night,</br>
I can't help myself.</br>
So please keep these photos of me.</br>
Tell ****** to kiss them now and again</br>
the way I have kissed her shoulder</br>
and we will never know again.</br>
If I could I would build you a Dome</br>
where you all could come to see me.</br>
I am happy here!</br>
Running with the sleek smiling Dogs!</br>
