Guardian Chromosome, hovering over the last radiating starOe of the species,
the flickering wick noticed at the far side of the room, gamete bits of
numbers, compact shapes and clover-like clusters of matter, the experience of
these and the thought of itself, each, flickering and permuting, associating
inexpliquably as life.

Jewel in the eye, the self-elequent toucher in my skin. Thoughts at this
throat, in this resonating glottis, coloring the feeling with the warm
moist brown maroon and red of animacy, the spine rising like a nerve stem
and blossoming from the question mark of curvature. Eyes and face lifting
from the ground as sense of smell gave way to te softness of vision. The tender
light touch upon stone, archetypal. Warmed by the dimming sunset just dark
enought to hint a star in the fading sky... eyes in the forehead, dome,
cupola,... reaching out into nothing for something to know and love....
the silent eloquence of the Night, transparent and opaque. One vast silent tone
of illumination reaching out into itself forever.

A sense of tragic loss and waste but it is too late. We have gone too
far to depend on vague fantasies, even if shared...  you blow out the cndle and
then the radiance of opaqueness, the limit of finite illumination upon a
surface at infinity... left there...
