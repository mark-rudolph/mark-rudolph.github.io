Held momentarily, an ambiguous bittersweetness.
the losing a(gain) and a(gain) and a(gain) of experience becomes a pose
for the consecration of image which scintillates in the heliotropic
tissue of experiencing and remembering...

*Tu*..just before her tspeech fades, short, concise, bittersweet, told not to,
intend or feel, and we could have tendered ourselves to each other but now...
a lo(r)ne waning... helixes of unfulfilled ture(n) wastefully to-o... 
away(h)er  then gone, not made, femade to... what is...

Is there a secret numinous complexity or is it given without question, the
rustling of branches and the mazes of flowers and paths illuminated in the
serene yellow resonance of warm late afternoon sunlight against violet shadows.
The calligraphy of perception and the amorphous immediate meaning of its
expression as all-encompassing self-infl(e)(i)cting s'o(a)erce.

The soft stuffing everywhere dense and extensive as if to hold something very
fragile and precious, and then the scintillating noticing sequins of itself
seemingly. The gift of being the Orpheus of itself, compelled to entice to
endure, over and over and over again as the instance, continually looking
back in love through the blindspot of possibility, preceding and containing
itself.

Ans since there is night loomimg behind even the afternoon sky, the 
flickering occhi in my eye wishes to forget. What could restrain me from
to-u... the breath of wind's soft chafe...  parla, take me adorna
