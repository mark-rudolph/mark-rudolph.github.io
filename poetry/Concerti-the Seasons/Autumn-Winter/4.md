Ophelia.
Inpe(a)c(k)tress.
The white roil shell of her self, so precocious but so ill.
Holding flowers, holding herbs, hanging down like a woman's perspired hair.

Undecided about vulnerability
mine and yours and ours
sometimes deeply and wholely
and sometimes capriciously
like a sparrow flitting about through the branches
striking and cutting the avid air,
laughing the lucid laugh of the self.

Waking, baked desert glass lacerating the present,
laughing smiling pleasing moist breath air 
its fiery blood-body wing drifting and spinning
without friction or resistance
cutting through nothing like thought,
the cold white light of Vermeer
and the blood-brown leaves of anti-spring.
Moving to each other as astringency,
our hearts falling softly like snow in big flakes and no wind
we do not understand the sensual mysteries
because together we become them,
a serene knot of skin and leaves and breath and wind.
