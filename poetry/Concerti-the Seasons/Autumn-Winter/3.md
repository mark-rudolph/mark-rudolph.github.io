Quiet snow fell through the crowns of trees. Lichen was growing in patches
on the bare branches and on the bark of the trunks but it was not parasitic.
It lived by breathing in and consuming the pure clear cold air. The bread
of thought, which can go bad, take this and eat, digest of it what you can
until the ergot, like a poison, betrays you to an otherwise easily avoided
St. Anthony's Fire.

Watching from the window the widening white and glowing air alive and
transparent, seeking across the chiasmal *arb*it*re*ment...the shattering glass,
breaking waves on the shore, rushing white noise inside the winds and then
a stunned silence... the stunned sparrow a crumpled heap on the sill,
leg flexing, having clutched. A tissue-picture of our anxiety, understood.
Abel to deny anything or nothing, either. Tightly holding the soft flower
without damage.
