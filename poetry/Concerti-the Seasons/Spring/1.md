And though these flowers have hummed vision all afternoon

Her face and body signify so much as she looks to me from her pastoral soul,
endowed with the touch and pose of the feel of soft moss, the fragrance of
humus, earth and air, animacy and mystery. A vast illusion of synapses and

until a deep compassion may enter in the eyes and nothing is any longer 
imposed between. It is the enigmatic seemingly animate indication, the sensory
calligraphy read without translation opening away from the entwined branches
into an allowing mandal, grain and whorl and bramch bending and lithely
explaining.
