Spoons rose from the saucers
we drank coffees as we talked.
We were animated. We walked in parks.
We were deeds, bright, out in the open,
breath and words, sounds.
Birds were not afraid.


Carve *pays* part my swan     bridge

It is all of it hidden inside itself
even inside the bounded part of separation.
What remains is memory until we cause the rest.


We bend under branches
and walk from the meadowgrounds.
The cool sweet wind makes play with our hair and open coats.


Evaporating like the cloth of thought
hiding and preserving the resurrecting Body,
her face and 'mine' rising like Cygnus in our eyes.
It is the same flutter      wind turning water
asking of it      itself      effortlessly providing


our lives     held
the imperceptible liquid, transparent and opaque window,:w

flowing to fill its tender containment.
