I remember picking a handful of dandelions below the DelaPiazza's grey
metal hand pump, and presenting them from behind my back to my mother when she
came to the screendoor.

I picked them to give her the elusive beauty seen inn the flowers, unaware of
impermanance, memory awakens.


It is the morning of the world and the endless afternoon.


Wandering in the maze of flowers planted in geometric patterns and labelled with
white wooden signs for a floral exhibition in the park. The women move in
longskirts with parasols.


Greasy fingerprints on cold shiny aluminum. The whorl of oppressive anxiety
gouged into a Munch woodcut. Lipstick and saliva on tasteless drinking glasses
purchased at the 'Wisco 99' gas station with special coupons now laying as
litter in open lots beneath gleaming orange 'FOR SALE' signs - the hot humid
endless afternoon. Roughhousing with adolescent girls just developing
breasts beneath white cotton t-shirts. Our bare legs gawking and plodding on
cold garage concrete, dry stinking grass clippings and sickly oil spots...
waiting...


The surface of a numb eye staring out at the void.
I live in an abandoned refrigerator with a nine year old first communicant 
dressed in white lace and a thin sere veil. Squatting in scattered feces and 
scavenged rinds of fruit and beating my clenched fists against the dull sides
of the porcelain metal hulk.


Inside, vacuum silently festering on draughty woodfloors. Behind every keyhole
a narcissistic dandy on a throne of pubescent fuzz seated before an eternal
mirror applying tiny slices of mousehair for false eyelashes and painting on
beauty marks on pale powdered rounded dimples. Through the keyhole of my
half optic hole I peek out at Delapiazza's old white house next door, fragments
of views of tasselled furniture coverings and shades and vases and rugs.

Damp hot air swollen and resonating with the smell of melons. Mild bulging 
aroma sliced with trenchant spice, cups yawning open like mouths, cake
pieces kissing apart in the frosting, two slices falling apart like martyrs
dropping to their knees.

is our lives.
