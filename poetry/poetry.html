</br>
</br>
The drowning man is the greatest singer - such evenness of tone and</br>
sincerity of expression in the midst of the overwhelming noise and motion.</br
</br>
</br>
But let's start at the beginning.</br>
</br>
It was just after the Schrodinger's Rat game that </br>
she decided to stay with her husband, that fat </br>
blockhead, and in a completely unrelated incident,</br>
K's collarbone struck my elongated fist made into</br>
a block of bone for the special occasion, fracturing</br>
some of the tender parts and sending him on a well</br>
deserved holiday.  Later I sent a federal express package</br>
to R., and an email to her cousin in Rio (with a</br>
nice surprise on the day before her gallery opening).</br>
It was a funny time, but not really.  It was during</br>
that period that I forgot how to smile, and I used</br>
to get a millisecond or so into the future by high</br>
velocity and zeal - I wanted to give Allah every chance to</br>
write zero on my forehead, but I can report in all honesty that </br>
there's nothing out there except for a Big Quiet, </br>
a quiet that chills even the most desperate blood.  </br>
</br>
Some days I could barely lift a spoon. </br>
Some days I didn't give a damn.  </br>
But I have found out that the drowning man is the greatest singer.</br>
What an evenness of tone at all pitches. What projection.</br>
What tenderness and abandonment of self-consciousness.</br>
It is a tone full of more and better poisons</br>
that drives you wildly to the artificial memory of </br>
all times and places while it makes you gag.</br>
</br>
<hr>
</br></br>

You endlessly arrive (it takes my breath away)</br>
With you I want to put folded clothing </br>
in scented drawers and I want to speak</br>
one word at a time,</br>
first me,</br>
then you,</br>
then me,</br>
this special way we will invent.</br>
When we play at love impossible things happen</br>
with surprising frequency.</br>
My bursting into your paper studio that first day.</br>
You and the piece of cloth you wore around your hips</br>
like a dress and threw outside your door in anger</br>
with your underwear wrapped inside.</br>
crazy brazilian woman.</br>
the smell of vanilla perfume</br>
the easy laughter</br>
the easy smile and dark eyes.</br>
Even if I stood outside in the rain for an hour</br>
thinking about it all </br>
I wouldn't understand.</br>
There is a plan for Lilac Time.</br>
It is out of our hands now</br>
but you will go away back to some land of nowhere,</br>
so please wear the silver ankle bracelet I gave you,</br>
run down your hallway,</br>
open up the broken shout, </br>
the broken cup,</br>
your reasons.</br>
Press your beautiful lips against the dome.</br>
Maybe this time around we could almost float</br>
if only we were just a little more happy,</br>
or just a little more dead.</br></br><hr>




</br>
</br>
Holding up my hands like wild ripped sails</br>
in the prevailing wind,</br>
the circulation of particles</br>
in differential equations</br>
it will not matter.</br>
You will never be as happy as you were.</br>
Either this is a great compliment to your previous life</br>
or it is a condemnation of what you have become.</br>
If you could re-live just one hour of holy innocense</br>
meant *just for you*,</br>
the noble belief in concepts,</br>
the easy smiling,</br>
the easy music from your throat,</br>
the wild thirst of autumn</br>
and the touch of waistline</br>
and the song of your own immortal hands.</br>
Everywhere an intoxicating  perfume of garlands of marigolds</br>
and the smell of colored leaves on the ground...</br>
</br>
How many faces did I know.</br>
How many times did I ask - "please tell me your middle name."</br>
Please walk with me to the bridge where branches point everywhere</br>
along the hillsides.</br>
At the place where the stone lions look on</br>
I will kiss you like it was the only moment ever lived by anything.
</br></br>

</br>
</br>
I thought I was invisible in a way that dogs</br>
would not bark or even lift an ear - this was when</br>
I got back from India.</br>
I thought birds would not be afraid and would land on my shoulders.</br>
I was wrong about many things.</br>
The rest is private.</br>
At this point my only concern is the release of JOY,</br>
the mortal perfumed combat and the same eternal story over and over</br>
and over the way it was when we were seventeen.</br>
They say it is a life wasted</br>
and maybe they're partly right,</br>
but we all die soon enough.</br>
So now we will again look at each other </br>
in that shyly desperate trance </br>
and in the end it will be part of the same eternal SMILE</br>
written on the faded photo </br>
laying on the kitchen table</br>
taken just before the accident.</br>
</br><hr>





</br>
</br>
Outside my land of divining</br>
if you have a stop on the road to love</br>
you can find me.</br>
In a turmoil of made of Fineness</br>
I will wait for you</br>
roses on my fingertips</br>
and waves of violet light all around me.</br>
In a song as warm as my hands you will hear words</br>
so soft and so still,</br>
warm and patient as sunset on an old stone building</br>
standing on a cliff above turquoise water </br>
in what seems like our memory.</br>
Each moment a different colour</br>
a different possibility</br>
a different life,</br>
all of them,</br>
I give to you,</br>
I give them to you again</br>
and more, much more,</br>
I don't even know what it is,</br>
I give it to you,</br>
over and over.</br>
