<h2>Part 4</h2></br>

</br>
</br>
Would you, oh could you, come with me?</br>
Only if you have a dress with blueberries on it.</br>
Only then.</br>
When you go out to find the one to live with forever</br>
would you, oh could you,</br>
wear the dress with the blueberries on it.</br>
When you go out for the last time in the world</br>
would you, oh could you,</br>
wear the dress with blueberries on it.</br>
She had on the dress with blueberries on it. so fine.</br>
And he had her perfume on his skin,</br>
and the moonlight burns my cheek again.</br>
Wouldn't it be nice?</br>
Simple as that.</br>
and the moonlight burns my cheek again.</br>
She had on the dress with blueberries on it,</br>
And he had her perfume on his skin.</br>
I've always wanted mermaids,</br>
but they've all died.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
I can remember when certain key friends were alive.</br>
I can hear one telling me about moving to Alaska - a land boom.</br>
Then he remembered something about someone</br>
we both knew smashing up in a sports car.</br>
Another friend of mine played the Irish harp.</br>
Then he played synthesizer.</br>
Then he died of l*.</br>
I could have been a better friend than I was.</br>
I left town determined to destroy my life in my own way.</br>
Its a done deal (8).</br>
Its a Bad Quiet.</br>
All of you who must, go to hell now,</br>
the rest, I have no advice.</br>
So leave me alone - you don't know me.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
lyrics -rain.</br>
white fog on the pathway to the garden.</br>
(wallpaper along the passageway is "fleur-de-lis"</br>
and intertwined ribbons)</br>
a fountain jet supports a hat of burning candles.</br>
Happy event.</br>
Oh Happy event.</br>
Photographs. Friends. Romance. Cutting momemts.</br>
I remember what has burned deep </br>
and I would give it all to you as a present.</br>
I hope you have half as many such moments.</br>
My most precious possessions are my 1007 Beads of Experience.</br>
I wear them on special occassions.</br>
In each is a tiny reflection - faces and moments.</br>
If you look carefully into them you might live Forever.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
There is more that I would say.</br>
I am thinking of days no one will ever know.</br>
If it is one time only,</br>
let it be far away,</br>
big snowflakes drifting down</br>
blowing endlessly in all directions.</br>
Out on the wild grasslands</br>
I am you.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
I did not come to know you just to learn,</br>
one more time, the relentless facts of "parting".</br>
If you were to leave your beautiful rhythm would be</br>
beyond my hands.</br>
Your black eyes hesitate like twilight where luck and favor may meet.</br>
Your smile reminds me, </br>
like a tiny bell I meant to give you</br>
as a present,</br>
of something I don't know yet.</br>
</br>
But I already gave away that bell - I didn't think you needed it</br>
(I didn't think you were coming back)</br>
I would have liked to have seen you come down a stairway</br>
two centuries ago in a gown no one would ever wear these days.</br>
If I have my way there will be costume parties</br>
for days and nights,</br>
and when the Good Angel strikes me with a road</br>
someone else's perfume from the endless afternoon </br>
will be sweet on my skin.</br>
You see, here,</br>
it's always Lilac Time...</br>
I wasn't supposed to tell you that</br>
but there, its done.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
To play at love seemed like a stupid and dangerous idea</br>
so it appealed to me.</br>
One more diversion from the relentless fact of needing a home.</br>
I always think there will be time to get things right.</br>
there will be time to save our lives.</br>
In the mean time</br>
go down to the town and get a bottle of wine</br>
go kiss the sultans daughter in her fragrant orchard</br>
listen to her murmur in another language</br>
no barriers on crossing into each others thought</br>
no plans</br>
no future</br>
repeating the eternal</br>
once more</br>
one more knowing of what "this" is</br>
in the passage of whatever "this" is.</br>
Its part of the high-speed stupidity I'm so good at.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
 </br>
Some say there are shadows sapping our fineness and our innocent trust</br>
Some say they will waste you and wither you </br>
while the blur flies by your eyes, made strangely quiet and resigned.</br>
I used to have scorn for those who said they were *tired*.</br>
Now I am tired.</br>
The readiness like a raw hand held out to receive</br>
whatever occasional flake of holiness</br>
able to cool our overheated reason.</br>
I didn't want to tell you,</br>
but it will be worse than now.</br>
Things don't rise up gracefully,</br>
they just descend,</br>
such a strange pathway down.</br>
Maybe you can learn to live in the Waiting Place.</br>
Maybe you can discover something *unexpected*.</br>
This is an age of Diminishment</br>
and I am only one in the Disloyal Opposition</br>
and I have no influence on the Collective Memory.</br>
You see, most of what we call *EveryThing*</br>
never really happened.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
 </br>
Just like the maid of the Maze</br>
you and your harlequin stockings and your split black skirt.</br>
When we play at love health is a lesser priority.</br>
This used to mean explorations of velocity over the dark roads</br>
under skies streaming with stars.</br>
It used to mean shouting words and phrases as they came to mind</br>
and dressing in unusual costumes,</br>
and turning on the stereo and two radios all at once</br>
and dancing in the Storm.</br>
Now there is a letter on the little table where you used</br>
to lay your keys or your bracelet.</br>
It says:</br>
"I'm better now and I send warm waning kisses"</br>
Below in the garden</br>
the future masquerades as paradise.</br>
</br>
</br>
Dear childhood,</br>
please don't come this way again.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
We fail one another.</br>
Sometimes one.  Sometimes the other.</br>
Mainly both.</br>
We fail although we are angels</br>
and kiss the azure bricks of the sky,</br>
our faces surrounded by all the glowing light </br>
in the world.</br>
That we live without crippling regret</br>
makes me think our hearts have turned to stone.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
Mountains.</br>
( I overhear)</br>
A womans voice talks about contentment</br>
and the best estimate of our good will.</br>
To the extent that there are wild places</br>
covered with pines and fir trees</br>
and filled solid with clear cold air</br>
there is a guide to our way Out.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
I stand by the tent.</br>
The fire makes un-moon-like light and the sky is an open dome.</br>
It is a pleasure to listen to conversations,</br>
a pleasure to feel the warm old stone of the walls,</br>
a pleasure to see the henna-haired waitresses</br>
here in the marketplace</br>
on the last evening of the World.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
Rehearsals for The love of Stories have paid off.</br>
The One we find out about</br>
by the collection of beads that we string through our lives</br>
with needle and skin</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
I have always had plans for Lilac Time,</br>
and I don't like false memories.</br>
I want to touch the ground and make a pine tree there.</br>
I want to touch someones face</br>
and see everything everywhere always.</br>
If there is one time only</br>
let it be here standing in the slowly falling snow.</br>
</br><hr>


</br>
</br>
Everyone clamoring to climb above the others</br>
lunging and stepping on shoulders and faces</br>
for recognition or money</br>
or a hundred other useless things.</br>
Me, I'm just sitting on the floor trying</br>
to amuse myself with pretty picture games</br>
while every goal and thing of value</br>
turns ridiculous.</br>
All I want is an honorable way out.</br>
I don't even care about being in anyone's memory.</br>
Just get me out.</br>
</br><hr>





</br>
</br>
I should have remained silent.</br>
I embarassed you I'm certain.</br>
I did think that maybe I had missed a message.</br>
What choice did I have when I didn't receive any email and there were</br>
difficulties with receiving anything at all.</br>
</br>
I am seeing things like never before.</br>
I am finding that my mother wants to become a baby.</br>
I am finding that my sister wants to pretend that she has nothing to</br>
do with any responsibility.</br>
It is a terrible time - and it has nothing to do with you.</br>
I can imagine that at such a time I might have to take up</br>
defense of someting very dear and valuable but but that I am so</br>
filled with close sorrow that I cannot lift a spoon.</br>
</br>
It may be better for the human race that men like me are killed off</br>
by our inferiors.</br>
The time is not right for us yet, if ever it will be - I laugh</br>
out loud for the first time in days...</br>
Whatever great purpose we could serve is inconceivable now</br>
and perhaps just a remnant of a long dead past.</br>
</br>
Please talk to me as if you didn't really understand</br>
what I said, and please welcome me as if I might matter to you.</br>
Please tell me where is your dream as I climb into your stable</br>
at dawn.  I want to know your story and your reluctance to tell me</br>
everything even as your mouth turns in a dream toward acceptance</br>
of some impossible idea that I will never be for you.</br>
</br>
Please run down some breakfast if you want, for us both,</br>
however - I don't need to eat, to sleep, to fall certain,</br>
I only come to serve you, as the blind come to touch the</br>
garments of travellers., so confident and so unaware of age and death.</br>
Why would one love a lovely red haired girl?</br>
Why would such a girl hide in pride a wisdom she should</br>
give easily - is this a fault, or is this an indifference?</br>
</br>
I would gladly discuss this with you my love but</br>
I have no left hand as it has no real purpose,</br>
it has lost circulation and lays limp now,</br>
it might better be described as haing been abandoned by my will,</br>
and my right hand has gone to find it's true master elsewhere,</br>
it's zeal has migrated like the sad geese calling to eavh other,</br>
again and again.</br>
and it is as if amidst the sad cries I must defend my useless life</br>
against a quite justified allegation of neglet and abandonment.</br>
</br>
So after all is said and done, tomorrow I will visit your clothing</br>
with the sound of a whisper, happy to slide along your skin and those</br>
wonderful scented garments I always found like treasure after the long</br>
introductions of the words and desires of the mouth.</br>
</br>
<hr>

</br>
</br>
Let me inject the deserving then...</br>
throat and hand - holding out the cold</br>
excuse of a piece of bread - a note, that says</br>
come back when I think kindness is more important</br>
than some form of what you call 'knowledge.'</br>
</br>
We will talk and eventually we will die.</br>
Others (our relatives will raise our heads to</br>
receive a drop of water even as we speak...</br>
we will say come here again with the same kindness</br>
you gave and you will sail through death unnoticing)</br>
