<h2>Part 2</h2></br>

<h3><a href="../index.html">Home</a></h3>
</br>
</br>
Got to stop wearing this tatoo.</br>
I've been told too many times.</br>
She's warm now.</br>
She comes out from under the blankets</br>
and asks.</br>
I explain:</br>
Our power was our idiocy.</br>
We were like stinking worms</br>
and we got what we deserved.</br>
And after that maybe you will feel like</br>
putting your hand through a window too.</br>
Maybe you will also then become as gentle as a lamb</br>
concerned only with apologizing</br>
for bleeding all over the carpet</br>
while others run around shouting.</br>
<br><hr>

</br>
</br>
No one told me it would be like this.</br>
It would stun you and make you reach for the ground</br>
to know the weight of sweetness not taken every day.</br>
It would fill a lifetime to understand it.</br>
Stories would occur.</br>
Birds would not be afraid.</br>
The days of life written on my forehead </br>
are as blank as a drum</br>
and now I am a parasite of anything</br>
which is contentment.</br>
It is time for payment for what has been done.</br>
For the chaos I have caused by my *affections*</br>
people don't even want to see me across a room.</br>
In those places I hardly recognize myself.</br>
Even if I stood outside in the rain for an hour </br>
I still wouldn't understand what has happened.</br>
If I had a dome I would pray in it.</br>
If I had a forest I would fall asleep on the soft ground</br>
under the pines.</br>
In my mind I kiss your eyes and we ride away</br>
fast along the gravel edge of the road</br>
to be as near to be as near to the trees as we can get</br>
and you reach out to touch the boughs as we pass,</br>
Noise</br>
Wind</br>
Acceleration</br>
Sky</br>
We will never be so alive as we are now.</br>
Take me in the fullness of preparation,</br>
ready for Immediate Paradise.</br>
</br><hr>



</br>
</br>
I will drink the poison from the local cup.</br>
Smoke. Coffee. Pills. Wine. Other things.</br>
the little death.</br>
A holiday of sickness.</br>
My throat is turning blue and I have six arms to hold you.</br>
I have seen the stars through the fast low clouds</br>
and I can hear the great rusty buzzsaw in the sky </br>
whining the long slow sinewave </br>
causing me to pray involuntarily.</br>
I'm going back inside with my 'friends'</br>
I can talk like an idiot and they will mercifully not even hear me</br>
they are so much worse off.</br>
Take this slow escalator down.</br>
It used to be 'adventure' but now</br>
you know what to do.</br>
Hold your head up high,</br>
smile into the face of Rose Memory,</br>
and Fail.</br>
Go down to your knees like a shot buffalo.</br>
Crumple to the sacred linoleum of our ancestors.</br>
</br><hr>


</br>
</br>
I know I screwed things up.</br>
I know you stopped trusting me</br>
and I know you are unhappy now.</br>
There's not much to say.</br>
Something false has become as strong as a trap.</br>
</br>
Failure.</br>
</br>
Reliability.</br>
</br>
Statelessness.</br>
</br>
I have lived touching the embroidered border on the blanket.</br>
I was made for it.</br>
</br>
I think of myself smiling,</br>
and I do.</br>
It is payment</br>
for not being you.</br>
</br><hr>



</br>
</br>
Parasite of the air</br>
I blacken the shadow behind you</br>
and then I am all over you</br>
with my swarming locust arms</br>
and the collective intelligence of a million tongueless idiots,</br>
no one caring,</br>
no one driving,</br>
dead leaf,</br>
physics at the edge of control</br>
the streaming particles afterglide and past.</br>
You will think it was a strange thought in the middle of the warm part of the day</br>
as you stroll along the sandy beach wearing only the thin dress made of</br>
some wild see-through artificial fabric.</br>
The smell of sweat and perfume makes me shudder and twist</br>
and I find you everywhere under the folds of that whispy dress.</br>
In other circumstances I would love to pin you against a tree</br>
and put my tongue into your mouth (I love trees so very much).</br>
I would like to see the wet hair against the pale skin under that fragrant dress.</br>
You will think it was a stranger thought</br>
or just a daydream</br>
but you will be sore there</br>
and there</br>
and even there,</br>
and it will make you smile</br>
(I can see you smiling now)</br>
From now on this smile will be known as "****** smilng..."</br>
and at that very moment</br>
I will be floating away from my abruptly halted body</br>
whispering "thank you all"</br>
thank you for preventing me from doing any more Harm.</br>
And if I'm lucky</br>
I will be going to a familiar meadow</br>
I have always known about.</br>
There I will raise bees on white clover,</br>
and there a woman will appear far away</br>
and walk up to me forever.</br>
she is barefoot,</br>
ankle bracelet jingling and</br>
mocassins dangling from her hand.</br>
</br>
</br>
Sincerely yours,</br>
</br>
the Warehouse of Experience</br>
</br><hr>



</br>
</br>
The reasons you give are just a train you take to go away.</br>
The collected wisdom of all times.</br>
The word that comes to the lips without thinking, is,</br>
Forget.</br>
</br>
No one can protect any one else.</br>
Micro-engineered pieces of truthful design</br>
pass through your skin like punctuation.</br>
Who spices this starvation diet?</br>
My worn steps.</br>
My brief afternoons in the house of the Blessed.</br>
Who would co-habit our bodies</br>
as I once wore you like a lovely uniform,</br>
my angularity there,</br>
and there.</br>
Cotton silence.</br>
Love in the afterglide.</br>
<br><hr>


</br>
</br>
Black sail - she isn't there.</br>
White sail - come up the stairs.</br>
the Dome.</br>
the place where dry leaves and paper</br>
fall upward,</br>
thankfully.</br>
These gifts of qualities we lace with our days and our plans.</br>
Our boats have visited every land and people.</br>
Still, </br>
our hope is that they bring only you.</br>
</br><hr>

</br>
</br>
If you have known contentment I will remind you.</br>
If you ahve become *precious* stone I will dissolve you.</br>
If you become the sky I will blacken your depth with pure time.</br>
And even if you become the ocean,</br>
I will drown you,</br>
although you will call it *being set on fire*,</br>
again</br>
and again</br>
and again</br>
and again...</br>
